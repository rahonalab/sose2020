# Languages of Europe - an Introduction to Linguistic Typology (sose2020)

The course is organised into two parts. In order to follow the second part it is mandatory to follow the first part.

1. a foundation part: six classes, 05th May to 09th June. You'll learn the basics of Linguistic Typology and we'll study together the first 60 pages of Croft's handbook. Two mini-exams will take place during the course. You'll earn 3ECTS, with or without grades, depending on how you have registered the course.
2. a monographic part: five classes, 16th June to 14th July. We'll analyse European languages from a typological perspective, in contrast with Languages of the World. You will then be assigned a seminar paper, which you will present in the last class. Together with the first part and the two mini-exams, you'll earn 5ECTS with grades.
